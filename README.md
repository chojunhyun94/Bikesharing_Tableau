# Bikesharing_Tableau

## Overview
We are looking at biking data for the month of August in 2019. This data represents the users of the Citi Bikes in NYC which can be useful in determining the efficacy of the bikes and potentially draw conclusions to have the bikes more prevalent. To visualize this data, I used Tableau which will help us draw these conclusions by contextualizing the data.

## Tableau Workbook
Tableau workbook is saved as 'Citi Bike Trip.twbx'

## Results
Here are some of the data.
